## Description:
Built a Interface, where users can add more fields, delete any fields and define its type too. When the Save button is clicked, it Console the updated data. The project can be used to receive flexible input data from users or can easily be integrated to any registration portals. As you can see we can sort of create an interface, users can add more fields by clicking the “+”
icon, delete any field, define a type like `string`, `number` etc.

Types that you should handle:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Object

# TASK
1. Create such component
2. It should be able to render this interface if given in some data form.
3. User should be able to edit name of a field
4. User should be able to add more fields
5. User should be able to delete a field
6. Users should be able to add nested fields to object type.
7. There should be a save button which console the updated data.

## Guideline
1. Assume a Schema for this, how you will represent this data. Write that down.
2. Write down how you will handle this, what components you will create. ( We are also interested in your thought process). Draw a diagram if needed (no extra marks for diagram)
3. Start small. Create a component which can render this data.
4. Add editable input field and update the data
5. Add a way to add more rows and update the data
6. Add a way to delete rows and update the data
